But before we do don't forget to subscribe or follow whatever platform you are on if you're interested in marketing business entrepreneurship growth,</p><p>whatever it is exactly. We got you covered. So let's talk about this digital marketing is changing every single day. In fact, I have a clip from the marking School podcast. We talked about how it's changing every single day.</p><p>If you think about it search is changing we an are days when we have questions we would have just Googled it, but now people are just asking things like Alexa what the answers are and because of that SEO</p><blockquote>is going to change into more and more voice search. I want to change this into voice search what you'll see is like you have Rich Snippets and Google taking your data. It's gonna get even worse which they're going</blockquote><p>to just take your data and show it through a microphone or speaker and you're not going to get anyone coming to your website because of that. In fact, look at this Google I think

In the last 20 18, I</p><p>believe they made over 13,000 changes to their to their algorithm. So these are changing all the time. So if you think about this, look what guess what LinkedIn we now have access to LinkedIn life. And this is as</p><p>of recently and a lot of things look Instagram has live LinkedIn has live Facebook has live. There's life everywhere. Right? So video is just going to continue to get bigger and bigger and bigger and I still get that</p> <img src="https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/texting-girl_1098-17954.jpg" alt="Digital Marketing 2020" title="Digital Marketing 2020" desc="Digital Marketing 2020" class="featured-image img-fluid"><p>same you like technology is getting better. Our bandwidth is getting better too. If you were talking about 5G, I don't see I don't see that going anywhere. So video has to be in your strategy now because we feel</p><p>like at a video like this. We actually repurpose this into short little social Clips as well. We also repurpose this into audio. We also might repurpose this into a blog post. So we have a lot of different we</p><p>can create a lot of different pieces of content just by utilizing video for wearing microphones that the quality is pretty good and you know, if you're listening to some podcasts this actually came from a video in the in</p><p>the first place, so they just going to get bigger and bigger the engagement that we're getting from these live.

Is is super high? Like the next thing I'm going to say is sure videos big but like when you go</p><p>live you can simulcast so we simulcast to Facebook YouTube twitch also the LinkedIn at the same time just to go live. Look that's great. Right engagement is great around the live videos you think about the gamers that are</p><p>you know, people that watch spent hours and hours watching Gamers play that is from live streaming. So live streaming is going nowhere videos going to get bigger and bigger Amazon is actually coming out with live streaming to so</p> <img src="https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/working-laptop_1098-17951.jpg" alt="Digital Marketing 2020" title="Digital Marketing 2020" desc="Digital Marketing 2020" class="featured-image img-fluid"><p>you have products out there. You will have the ability to run live streams on Amazon to next thing that I want to talk about was voice even though you have Amazon Alexa, you have all these different maybe you</p><p>have Google home. Like it's very it's very primitive right now. You can ask all I talked to my elects about is the one that right now, how's the weather and then might life second command is how's the weather</p><p>for the next seven days? Those are the only two things I asked for right now the weather. Okay, let's go get stronger and stronger. And also when you ask for a when you when you're doing searches, I think</p><p>on mobile right now, I think might be like

40% or so of searches or our voice? Right? But it's very transactional. So what you have to be of be paying attention to is if voice search is getting bigger, you</p><p>have to try to get that rank 0 snippet because those are what like Alexa or Google home pull from the answer a question. Right? Like, you know, you know, what is the capital of California Sacramento? Right? That's like</p><p>that's that's how it works voice is gonna get bigger and bigger. Yes Stephen optimized for rank 0 and let's move on to the next thing Rand fishkin actually did a study this was he did a study with jump</p><p>shot and this is on his blog spark Toro, but the number of 0 click searches are continuing to rise meaning that when people land on a search result page, they actually aren't able to if they aren't going to</p><p>click to go to the website. They're getting their answer on the page. So what you have to do is if your ranking for rings are on the page, you have to make the most of the on surp SEO</p><p>meaning you have to optimize that to so if you if you rank for a query like how to tie a tie Maybe

Where you say? Hey, by the way, if you want to learn more about ties or style go</p><p>to Noah's tie blog.com. Okay, and you know, there's a little branding opportunity in there. So you have to learn how to do on serve SEO also on the other side reason why we develop the software that we have</p><p>code click flow. So you can optimize titles and meta descriptions to rank higher to get a higher click-through rate when it comes to when it comes to Google because if you rank for something like red shoes and have</p><p>another one another title called red shoes top review for 2019. You're probably going to click on the second one, right? It's got a better title. It's more enticing for you to click on so on syrup SEO optimized your</p><p>titles and meta descriptions all that good stuff. I have a podcast called marking school. I talked about marketing every single day. I do videos on it every single day and you know, these are the things that I'm hearing</p><p>all the time. But what I think is not going to go away to is is in person like we had our conference marking school life and a lot of people showed up for that. We capped it at about</p><p>200 people I think about 150 160. People showed up. I think it's around. It does a couple other people think it's around that range to my team kind of things is different. But anyway, so Marcus kowal live the</p><p>having that live event having those life touch points, right? We had a client to sign on with us potential clients that were about to sign on with us, but I think we're in contract final negotiations or reference checks</p><p>right now with one of them. It's because we had that in-person touch of white write all of the things that are talking we were talking about all of the people that they got to meet all of the speakers</p><p>that we had being able to do those live events, which is wind that's leading to us kneel like doing our growth accelerator vast white which by the way you can go to market School the aisles watch live at</p><p>cell. I ve to apply for our Mastermind, but the we realized that the power of Live Events is its unparalleled because people want to have connection with other people and those are listening right now or watching this right</p><p>now. Look we're planning to do another conference in January or February my even 500 500 people are or a thousand people are so so live events are not going to go anywhere and they're just gonna get better and</p><p>better stronger and stronger over time.

Let me live stream that that's well. And by the way going back to live streaming. I want to talk about because live streaming is so good for increasing your watch time. You want to</p><p>like if you are optimizing on YouTube, you gotta think about having longer videos for watch time, which is why we're trying to convert videos like this to longer watch times because that's going to be able to stay longer</p><p>your figures are going to show more and you know, that that that is something that is going to continue more people are going to continue to Trend down at their that direction because everyone's making the short-form videos moving</p><p>on from that look we talk about voice search we talked about 0 click searches. We talked about live streaming. There's all these different things happening right also as these ad platforms, even though we all love them, they're gonna</p><p>get more and more expensive. Okay, ten years ago. Facebook ads wasn't around Twitter ads weren't around and Gogol Gogol is reaping and all the dough right and you know that they're often based system. So adjective get more and</p><p>more expensive Facebook as ad ad based system where auction-based system whereas are going to get more expensive as well. Um, so what's gonna happen is you know, all the other people are playing be at this return on investment</p><p>game, you know cost of acquiring a customer cat ratio LTV ratio, these are important games to play and but if you can't just rely on ads you're going to be in trouble you cannot just rely on ads so</p><p>you have to think about how you can diversify and protect yourself. The good news for you is Pinterest and Amazon are going to continue to get stronger and stronger. There are Amazon especially is rising very very quickly. So</p><p>pay attention to those as well. And the other thing I want to say around position of working is going to change is all the data that you're ingesting if you're building if you've built an audience is you want</p><p>to utilize customer data platforms or cdp's we use one called home hole. That's hu l dot IO and we're able to look at Cruise visiting our site and then put them into account based marketing sequences, or we can</p><p>Market to a bunch of people on their team. The other thing I want to add is when I think about the markets go podcast if I look at over the years how Neil and I have

Done things in the</p><p>very beginning when especially when I was learning marketing. He already had his Squad quick Sprout and all he would do is block and over the years. I would talk to him that they had like we probably should take</p><p>a look at video. You should probably take a look at podcast to write. The reason we have a podcast is it kept telling him podcast is amazing and I told a video is amazing to he got into video</p><p>too. And I think I told him to do everything right but you know, he realized the need to kind of have to take this multi-channel approach. It seems same thing what we do right? We have our blog we</p><p>have our YouTube channel. We have our podcast that we have. Okay, a lot of lip service to but they actually aren't doing you have to do that to be able to cover yourself. So that's going to help you</p><p>in terms of building a brand who else does a good job with this Gerry Dee does a really good job with this. In fact, I think he produces a hundred pieces of content every single day and he has</p><p>a he has like a iMessage group of like 30 people in it and you know the start with the peanut like a video like this the throne video in there and that everyone jump on the video chop it</p><p>up with different pieces chop it up. It's a blog post, you know, and then trouble into podcast is to read into like SoundCloud Spotify Apple podcast Google podcast Stitcher just play everywhere, right and it becomes just a giant</p><p>machine and the personal favorite is so much fun that I think they they're always, you know, last time I checked they would be like two to three days away from running out of cont'd so maybe they've been proved</p><p>that that process now, but that's the level that you know, some people are at and if you if you can play a little bit tell them maybe like five pieces they are ten pieces there. I think you're gonna</p><p>be in a good spot and you can give to a hundred a day, you know all the more power to you.</p></div><div class="after-post-tags"><ul class="tags"><li><a href="#digital marketing 2020">digital marketing 2020</a></li> <li><a href="#digital">digital</a></li> <li><a href="#marketing">marketing</a></li> <li><a href="#2020">2020</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div>﻿				<div class="container">
