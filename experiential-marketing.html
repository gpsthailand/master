I'm going to tell you</p><p>all about it. So first, let's take a step back way back. What is an experience and how would you define it? So an experience to me could be all these things or it could be none of these things</p><p>experiences are undefinable, but they're also super personal and that is the power of them is my son. One thing we can all agree on is that first experiences are the most memorable powerful of them all. I'm not talking</p><blockquote>about like backpacking across

My layers are kayaking and Antarctica and I'm talking about are the little things in life. I'm talking about first kiss baby being born the passing of a loved one. And these are the type of experiences</blockquote><p>that bind us all in a global sense and some of us like myself are experienced at us and what that means is that we travel from career career from job to job and place to place in search of</p><p>that feeling of first experience and at the end of the day, that's how we end up in experiential and that's how people end up in my company think well and that's why I started the company. So how does</p><p>defying experiences related to advertising? So this is traditional advertising. I'm sure you guys have seen a lot of a lot of the stuff is commercial Prince billboard bust up and this is what I call new traditional advertising templates</p> <img src="https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/young-asian-female-traveler-with-backpack-traveling-ayutthaya-province-thailand_1150-18183.jpg" alt="Experiential marketing" title="Experiential marketing" desc="Experiential marketing" class="featured-image img-fluid"><p>for everything and we have to ask ourselves. How do you feel when you look at these? What a brand is basically doing is telling you I want you to feel a certain way.

And I want you to buy my</p><p>product and to me that's a pretty passive Unforgettable experience when advertising has the ability to change the world forever. And in today's new world of advertising Brands want to be influenced by you and that is a big deal</p><p>and that's super important. This is an image from campaign. We did for Levi's this is an actual photo that someone took someone else this isn't for commercial. This isn't a professional photo shoot. This is the real thing and</p><p>a lot of people a lot of Brands asked me in a lot of advertisers. How do we engage with people like her? How do we engage with consumers and users of today? And I said, well, first of all,</p><p>you can't look at people as consumers our users you have to look at them as humans experience will to me and this is something that that is a big Mantra my is environmental to human design and what that</p><p>means is you walk into a space that space curates itself and is a beautiful back and forth between you and experiential is not a medium. But a belief it's a belief that when you walk into one of those</p> <img src="https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/young-asian-female-traveler-with-backpack-traveling-ayutthaya-province-thailand_1150-18187.jpg" alt="Experiential marketing" title="Experiential marketing" desc="Experiential marketing" class="featured-image img-fluid"><p>experiences you can emotionally

I connected to that experience and your life before ever change and that's a big deal. That is something that Brands and advertisers are trying to do for a really long time. And also to me that's</p><p>why experiential will be forever agile, and I say this a lot but it's the last Bastion of advertising to me three key points that I come up with over the years and I guess I've been doing this seven</p><p>issues now that make for really awesome experience organ spiritual campaign here. Well, here are three key points. The first one is active not passive engagement and an example of that would be let's say you go to an event</p><p>and there's a bar with influencers there. There's some local fashion designers putting some stuff on the wall and there's some cool 80s movies being projected on the wall. That's an event. It's a pretty cool event, but it's just</p><p>an event but if you go to an event and there was an influence as an influencer is out the bar and they want to play some cool video games with you to create some custom cocktails and then you</p><p>walk up to some local fashion designers and they used to give you a spray can and then you and a fashion designer spray paint all the clothes and get to take it home with you and then

Look at 80s</p><p>movies projected on the wall. You see your face and saline all of them that's experiential and it's super cool to it has to be loved simply put if you go to a music concert probably probably pretty fun, but</p><p>it's just music. But if you go to a music concert and there's haptics on the floor and there's sense in the audience and their generator of live visuals based on the music. That's experiential to me. Third big point</p><p>for me is that an experience has to be multi-sensory and what that means? Is it hits all of your senses? And to me creates the most memorable and honest experience of them all. So what does this look like</p><p>in real life? I'm gonna show you guys some stuff. This is a project. We did for a Google and Coke and basically what you can do is you can send a free code and a video message says to</p><p>a stranger anywhere in the world. This is a project we did for Lexus through a secret Facebook contest. You got sensors secret hanger in Italy where you got to play real-life video again with an F1 driver and will</p><p>tell me. This is a project we different Levi's where you got the collaborate in real-time with musicians and artists using hacked instruments and tools on a train traveling cross-country. This is a project we did for 7UP where we</p><p>created the multi-sensory concert for Deaf kids where they showed up they were super surprise. We have a number one DJ in the world Martin Garrix playing and I think what I remember one of them saying at the end</p><p>of the end of this is this this is changed my life forever and that's something you want to hear when your inexperience and lastly. This is a project we did with New York Times 20th Century Fox and I</p><p>am and what we did was we created an augmented reality experience where we took NASA scientists that were overlooked by history and we place them in your phone and you can place them in real life will augmented life</p><p>anywhere in the world. And this was a really powerful experience. We did this last year and it works. So these are real-life social posts from experiences. You just saw as well as some of the other experiences that I</p><p>worked on over the years and what you're seeing here is is amazing and what you're seeing here is true brand love and that's something that Brands and advertisers have been striving for for decades and we just get it</p><p>here. And so we're in an age of experience here and it's here to stay Brands want you to help build worlds, and they want you to help build it. Thanks.</p><p></p></div><div class="after-post-tags"><ul class="tags"><li><a href="#Experiential marketing">Experiential marketing</a></li> <li><a href="#Experience">Experience</a></li> <li><a href="#Advertising 2020">Advertising 2020</a></li> <li><a href="#Marketing">Marketing</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div>﻿				<div class="container">
